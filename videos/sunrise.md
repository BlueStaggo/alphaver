## Description
Cut content(?)

"This was a rare event that [5] and [2] proposed once. [0], as per his policy, wanted them to justify its presence in the game besides cosmetic reasons, so they upped the difficulty."

"I am unsure if it made it into Lilypad, and I don't really want to check now, it takes too long for this event to normally appear"



"It's insensitive of some of you to impersonate someone who's not with us anymore."
"And hadn't been for a long while, [2] was the oldest person in the developer team"
